A collection of scripts that were helpful migrating phones and testing our e911 system.

This uses the OSSI client code for Avaya phone switches (Communications Manager) that Ben from the University of Washington wrote.

His method was to develop a full web service system. I just wanted to write a couple script to make my life easier.

Some of these scripts relate to local assumptions and names, outputs of other internal scripts, and whatnot.  I included them as additional example can be helpful when trying to figure out good ways of getting and setting fields on CM.

Everything I wrote I'm keeping under the license of the code I used. Figure things are easier that way.
